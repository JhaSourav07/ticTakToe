# 🔥 Firebase Setup Guide (Required)

This app uses **Firebase Firestore** for real-time multiplayer functionality.  
You must connect the project to your own Firebase project before running the app.

---

## 🚀 Step 1: Create a Firebase Project

1. Go to the **Firebase Console**  
   https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Click **Add Project**
3. Name it `TicTacToeParty` (or any name you prefer)
4. (Optional) Disable **Google Analytics**
5. Click **Create Project**

---

## 🤖 Step 2: Configure Android

1. In Firebase dashboard, click the **Android icon (🤖)**
2. Find your **Android Package Name**:
   - Open:
     ```
     android/app/build.gradle
     ```
   - Find:
     ```gradle
     applicationId "com.example.tictactoe"
     ```
   - Copy and paste this value into Firebase

3. Click **Register App**
4. Download the file `google-services.json`
5. Move it to:
   ```
   android/app/google-services.json
   ```
   ✅ Android setup complete.

---

## 🍎 Step 3: Configure iOS (Mac Only)

1. Click **Add App → iOS**
2. Find your **iOS Bundle ID**:
- Open:
  ```
  ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj
  ```
- Search for:
  ```
  PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER
  ```
- Copy that value into Firebase

3. Click **Register App**
4. Download `GoogleService-Info.plist`
5. Move it to:
   ```
   ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist
   ```
✅ iOS setup complete.

---
## 🗄 Step 4: Create Firestore Database

1. In Firebase Console, go to:
  Build → Firestore Database
2. Click **Create Database**
3. Choose a location (e.g., `nam5 (us-central)`)
4. ⚠️ Select **Start in Test Mode**

> Test Mode allows public read/write access for 30 days.  
> For production, you must configure authentication and secure rules.

---
## 🔐 Step 5: Verify Security Rules (Development Only)

Go to the **Rules** tab in Firestore and make sure it looks like this:

### Important: Enable Anonymous Auth + Secure Firestore Rules
The default “Test mode” rules (`allow read, write: if true`) are only for local testing. For any production usage, you must enable Firebase Authentication (Anonymous Auth is fine) and replace your Firestore rules.

Step 4 (recommended): Enable Authentication
Firebase Console -> Authentication -> Sign-in method:
* Enable `Anonymous`.

Step 5: Set Firestore Security Rules
Firebase Console -> Firestore Database -> Rules, replace the rules content with:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /rooms/{roomId} {
      function isSignedIn() {
        return request.auth != null;
      }

      function myUid() {
        return request.auth.uid;
      }

      function isPlayer() {
        return resource.data.player1Id == myUid() || resource.data.player2Id == myUid();
      }

      // Read: authenticated users can read their own room, or any room that still has an open slot.
      // Full rooms stay private.
      allow read: if isSignedIn() && (
        isPlayer() ||
        resource.data.player1Id == '' ||
        resource.data.player2Id == ''
      );

      // Create: the creator becomes player1.
      allow create: if isSignedIn() &&
        request.resource.data.player1Id == myUid() &&
        request.resource.data.player2Id == '' &&
        request.resource.data.turn == myUid() &&
        request.resource.data.board.size() == 9;

      allow update: if isSignedIn() && (
        // Join empty player1 slot
        (
          request.writeFields().hasOnly(['player1Id', 'player1Name']) &&
          resource.data.player1Id == '' &&
          request.resource.data.player1Id == myUid()
        ) ||

        // Join empty player2 slot
        (
          request.writeFields().hasOnly(['player2Id', 'player2Name']) &&
          resource.data.player2Id == '' &&
          request.resource.data.player2Id == myUid()
        ) ||

        // Reconnect: idempotent update of your own slot
        (
          request.writeFields().hasOnly(['player1Id']) &&
          resource.data.player1Id == myUid() &&
          request.resource.data.player1Id == myUid()
        ) ||
        (
          request.writeFields().hasOnly(['player2Id']) &&
          resource.data.player2Id == myUid() &&
          request.resource.data.player2Id == myUid()
        ) ||

        // Leave: clear your own slot
        (
          request.writeFields().hasOnly(['player1Id']) &&
          resource.data.player1Id == myUid() &&
          request.resource.data.player1Id == ''
        ) ||
        (
          request.writeFields().hasOnly(['player2Id']) &&
          resource.data.player2Id == myUid() &&
          request.resource.data.player2Id == ''
        ) ||

        // Move: only the user whose turn it is can update (board + next turn)
        (
          request.writeFields().hasOnly(['board', 'turn']) &&
          resource.data.turn == myUid() &&
          (resource.data.player1Id == myUid() ? resource.data.player2Id : resource.data.player1Id) != '' &&
          request.resource.data.turn == (
            resource.data.player1Id == myUid()
              ? resource.data.player2Id
              : resource.data.player1Id
          )
        ) ||

        // Winner / game state updates
        (
          request.writeFields().hasOnly(['winner', 'isGameActive', 'player1Score', 'player2Score', 'winningLine']) &&
          isPlayer()
        ) ||

        // Rematch reset (no identity changes, just board/turn/state)
        (
          request.writeFields().hasOnly(['board', 'turn', 'winner', 'isGameActive', 'winningLine']) &&
          isPlayer() &&
          request.resource.data.player1Id == resource.data.player1Id &&
          request.resource.data.player2Id == resource.data.player2Id
        )
      );
    }
  }
}
```
